	abstract = {In the present paper, a newly developed measurement method of sound radiation efficiency, called the discrete calculation method ({DCM}), is presented, and the usefulness of {DCM} is verified by measurements of various vibrating objects. The proposed method is a hybrid method comprising both vibration measurement and calculation of radiation impedance. Since the proposed method does not require the measurement of sound fields, this method provides the following features, which conventional methods do not possess: (1) {DCM} can be applied to measurement in a low-frequency range and to a noisy sound field, such as construction sites; (2) high precision appears possible, because the sound radiation efficiency can be obtained without the sound measurement. These features, wide application and high precision, are essential for sound radiation measurement. The usefulness of the {DCM} as a measurement method for sound radiation is determined by performing measurements of various specimens.},

By applying the localization landscape theory, the resonant frequencies and regions of the localized modes can be obtained experimentally. This is implemented by a quasi-static measurement of the membrane deformation, and is performed without the knowledge of its tension field or any hypothesis about its homogeneity (uniform or non-uniform). The results are compared with Finite Element simulations and modal measurements made in vacuum conditions.},

	abstract = {This volume, available for the first time in paperback, is a standard work on the physical aspects of acoustics. Starting from first principles, the authors have successfully produced a unified and thorough treatment of the subjects of generation, propagation, absorption, reflection, and scattering of compressional waves in fluids, progressing to such topics as moving sound sources, turbulence, and wave-induced vibration of structures. Material is included on viscous and thermal effects, on the acoustics of moving media, on plasma acoustics, on nonlinear effects, and on the interaction between light and sound. Problems, with answers in many cases, are given at the end of each chapter. They contain extensions to further applications, thus enhancing the reference value of the book. Many of the examples worked out in the text and in the problem solutions were not previously published. Anyone familiar with calculus and vector analysis should be able to understand the mathematical techniques used here.},
